Abstract:

Generating music can seem uncomplicated when there are given parameters such as rhythm, dynamics, intensity, and pitch; however, generating music from an emotion can be quite difficult. There have been many projects with similar goals, such as inputting a database of song lyrics and generating an accurate tag or genre for the song. We want to be able to generate music given a mood, based on other songs with a respective ‘emotional tag’ that we would have the algorithm train. First, we need to create and expand a dataset. To do this, we will be using a support vector machine to create labels of a song based on factors such as valence (musical positivity) and arousal. Next, we will train a recurrent neural network by using a database of songs’ and their emotional tags. Our ultimate goal is to generate a song given an emotional tag.
